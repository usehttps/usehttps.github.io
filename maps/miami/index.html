<h2 id="travel-guide">Travel Guide</h2>
<h3 id="things-to-do">Things to Do</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, Miami offers much more than just an epic party scene:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wynwood Walls</strong> &ndash; street art paints the walls of alleyways and formerly downtrodden buildings in this revitalized neighborhood</li>
<li><strong>Art Deco District, South Beach</strong> &ndash; South Beach is more than a party with the historical Art Deco buildings lining the streets</li>
<li><strong>Little Havana</strong> &ndash; Calle Ocho, Maximo Gomez Park, Ball &amp; Chain, and Versailles are just  a few culturally significant points of interest in this Cuban enclave</li>
<li><strong>Cape Florida Lighthouse</strong> &ndash; the climbable 19th-century lighthouse reveals epic views of Biscayne Bay and downtown Miami</li>
<li><strong>Vizcaya Museum &amp; Gardens</strong> &ndash; Experience opulence at James Deering&rsquo;s Mediterranean-style villa overlooking Biscayne Bay in Coconut Grove</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h3>
<p>Between downtown and the beach, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of options on where to stay: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>South Beach, Miami Beach</strong> &ndash; boutique hotels occupy the neon-lit art deco buildings of Miami&rsquo;s most famous beachfront neighborhood</li>
<li><strong>Downtown Miami</strong> &ndash; events, museums, art galleries, and other things to do are never lacking in Miami&rsquo;s downtown district</li>
<li><strong>North Beach, Miami Beach</strong> &ndash; a quiet and family-friendly alternative to the partygoers of South Beach</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beaches">Beaches</h3>
<p>Miami&rsquo;s entire coastline is filled with the only true tropical beaches found in the continental United States:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park</strong> &ndash; family-friendly beach on Key Biscayne shadowed by a 19th-century lighthouse</li>
<li><strong>Haulover Beach</strong> &ndash; a popular oceanfront park with picnic tables, BBQ grills, and restroom facilities</li>
<li><strong>South Beach, Miami Beach</strong> &ndash; lively beach geared towards partygoers and Spring Breakers</li>
<li><strong>North Beach, Miami Beach</strong>&ndash; quiet alternative to the craziness of South Beach </li>
<li><strong>Crandon Park, Key Biscayne</strong> &ndash; picturesque sandy shore directly cut from a Caribbean postcard</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-time-to-visit">Best Time to Visit</h3>
<p>Miami is as tropical as it gets in the United States. Therefore, our temperatures are always mild to hot year-round with plenty of sunshine and more rain than you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<ul>
<li>🌼 <strong>Spring</strong> &ndash;  best season to visit with warm temperatures and minimal rainfall. As such, most expensive time to visit</li>
<li>🌞 <strong>Summer</strong> &ndash;  scorching temperatures and daily afternoon rainfalls. Excellent beach and boating conditions in the mornings.</li>
<li>🍂 <strong>Fall</strong>&ndash;  Cheapest time to visit due to hurricane season, heavy rainfall, and high humidity.</li>
<li>❄️ <strong>Winter</strong> &ndash;  Mild temperatures with the occasional cold spell passing through.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h3>
<p>If staying in downtown or South Beach, a rental car may not be necessary. Otherwise, here are some other ways to get around South Florida:</p>
<ul>
<li>🚶‍♀️ <strong>Walking</strong> &ndash; Downtown Miami and South Beach are the safest and most walkable neighborhoods.</li>
<li>🚗 <strong>Driving</strong> &ndash; recommended if wanting to visit or stay in surrounding areas. Unnecessary if staying in South Beach.</li>
<li>🚇 <strong>Public Transit</strong> &ndash; efficient trolley system moves up and down Collins Ave in Miami Beach. MetroMover is a cheap way to go around downtown.</li>
<li>📲 <strong>Ride Share</strong> &ndash; affordable outside of peak hours. Evening Ride Shares in South Beach and Brickell prove to be costly.</li>
<li>🚴‍♀️ <strong>Biking</strong> &ndash; Miami Beach in its entirety is safe for cycling along the Boardwalk &amp; cycling lanes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips--things-to-know">Tips &amp; Things to Know</h3>
<ul>
<li>📕 <strong>Practice Your Spanish</strong> &ndash; particularly if you&rsquo;re visiting areas outside of the main tourist neighborhoods of South Beach and downtown.</li>
<li>💦 <strong>Prepare for the Humidity</strong> &ndash; on top of the heat, the humidity can be insane</li>
<li>🥵 <strong>Beat the Heat</strong> &ndash; a dip in the ocean, pool or an escape into the A/C are the best ways to cool off</li>
<li>☂️ <strong>Expect Rain</strong> &ndash; afternoon showers occur daily, especially in the summer</li>
<li>🌅 <strong>Plan Outdoor Activities in the AM</strong> &ndash; when temperatures are the coolest and the winds are the calmest</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-pack">What to Pack</h3>
<ul>
<li>🧴<strong>Reef Safe Sunscreen</strong> &ndash; popular sunscreen brands contain harmful chemicals to our local coral reefs. Choose a reef-safe brand instead</li>
<li>👕<strong>UPF Clothing</strong> &ndash; the South Florida sun is no joke to your skin. It&rsquo;s best to cover up.</li>
<li>🎒<strong>Dry Bag Backpack</strong> &ndash; with so many water activities, a dry bag is a great way to keep your valuables dry</li>
<li>🕶️<strong>Sunglasses</strong>&ndash; after all, you&rsquo;re here for the beach, aren&rsquo;t you?</li>
<li>🦟 <strong>Bug Spray</strong>&ndash; despite being in a city, mosquitoes are wicked year-round in Miami</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-around-miami-using-metrorail">GETTING AROUND MIAMI USING METRORAIL</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/transit/metrorail.asp">Metrorail</a> is a 25-mile elevated rail system similar to a monorail, but with two tracks. This is a fast and inexpensive way to get you from the <a href="http://www.miami-airport.com/">Miami International Airport (MIA)</a> through Downtown Miami all the way to South Miami. It&rsquo;s an easy way to reach the Civic Center, Jackson Memorial Hospital area, Hialeah, and northwest Miami-Dade, with connections to Broward and Palm Beach counties at the Tri-Rail/Metrorail transfer station.</p>
<p>If you need to get to Miami International Airport, you&rsquo;ll want to take the special Metrorail Orange Line. It connects the Miami Intermodal Center transportation hub where you can take the <a href="http://www.miami-airport.com/map-skytrain.asp">MIA Mover</a> to the airport.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/transportation/transit-fares.page">Metrorail fares</a> start at $2.25. <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser1519847051955263">Easy Tickets</a> can be purchased at any Metrorail station. (Cash payment is accepted at the Ticket Vending Machine next to the fare gate). For frequent commuters, you can purchase the $2 <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser1519766209086486">EASY Card</a> at any Metrorail station or online. The EASY Card can easily be re-loaded via the <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser1578323661475590">GO Miami-Dade Transit app</a> for a quick tap and go experience at the station.

<h2 id="getting-around-downtown-miami-using-metromover">GETTING AROUND DOWNTOWN MIAMI USING METROMOVER</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to explore Downtown Miami, <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/transportation/metromover.page">Metromover</a> is hands-down the best option. Metromover is a free public transportation service offering small loops around Downtown Miami and Brickell, and serves as a connection between Metrorail and <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/transit/metrobus.asp">Metrobus</a>. The Metromover has three major loops: Omni Loop, Inner Loop and Brickell Loop.</p>
<p>Metromover is great for visitors staying or traveling in Downtown Miami with a desire to explore some of the city&rsquo;s most popular attractions. The Metromover can drop you off near <a href="https://www.ftxarena.com/">FTX Arena</a>, home of the Miami Heat and lots of popular concerts; <a href="http://www.bayfrontparkmiami.com/">Maurice A. Ferré Park</a>, home of the <a href="http://www.pamm.org/">Pérez Art Museum Miami</a> and the <a href="https://www.frostscience.org/">Frost Museum of Science</a>; as well as the Art &amp; Entertainment District, where you&rsquo;ll find the <a href="https://www.arshtcenter.org/">Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts</a>.</p>
<p>There are many shops and restaurants along the Metromover route so be sure to take advantage of this free way to avoid traffic and enjoy all the attractions Downtown Miami has to offer.</p>
<h2 id="miamis-city-buses">MIAMI&rsquo;S CITY BUSES</h2>
<p>Metrobus operates more than 95 routes with nearly 1,000 buses covering 41 million miles per year. That&rsquo;s a lot of ground to cover! If you can&rsquo;t get where you&rsquo;re going with the Metrorail or the Metromover, hop on one of the buses that serve areas of the city that the rail doesn&rsquo;t, such as Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Homestead or even as far afield as Fort Lauderdale or the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Designed to intersect with Metrorail and Metromover, Miami-Dade County&rsquo;s bus system serves all major shopping, entertainment and cultural centers, as well as major hospitals and schools. There&rsquo;s even an express bus service during rush hour and a <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/marlins-shuttle.asp">Marlins Shuttle</a> from April through September from Culmer Metrorail Station to LoanDepot Park so baseball fans can catch a world-class baseball game.</p>
<p>Bus rides start at $2.25 per trip. As with Metrorail, the easiest way to pay for a bus ride is with an EASY Card or EASY Ticket. Travelers can purchase them online and at select stations. Figure out how to get where you&rsquo;re oging using the Metrobus System Map, then check individual <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/routes.asp">route schedules</a> for all of the system&rsquo;s bus routes. Download the Go Miami-Dade Transit app for on-the-go information.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re staying in Miami Beach and need to get to Miami International Airport, check out <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/transportation-publicworks/routes_detail.asp?route=150">Miami Beach Bus Route 150</a>. This express bus service runs frequently Miami International Airport and Miami Beach, with stops at 41st Street, Alton Road, Collins Avenue, Lincoln Road, and Washington Avenue.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re vacationing in Miami Beach, you&rsquo;ll want to familiarize yourself with <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/transportation-publicworks/routes_detail.asp?route=120">Route 120</a>. This bus, preferred by South Beach visitors and residents alike, stops frequently in popular spots around Miami Beach, Surfside, Bal Harbour, Aventura Mall and Haulover Park Marina. If you&rsquo;re looking to travel farther afield, Route 120 stops at the Downtown Miami Bus Terminal where you&rsquo;ll have easy access to the Main Library, Historical Museum, Miami Art Museum, Government Center Metrorail station, Miami Dade College Wolfson Campus, and the Omni Bus Terminal.</p>

<h2 id="riding-the-metromover">Riding the Metromover</h2>
<p>This free (yes, free) mass transit automated people mover is operated by Miami-Dade Transit and serves the downtown area including Brickell, Park West, and the Arts &amp; Entertainment District neighborhoods.

<h2 id="trolley-service">Trolley Service</h2>
<p>The City of Miami has a free trolley with routes throughout Little Havana, Coconut Grove, Wynwood, Coral Way, Brickell, Allapattah and more. For information about the schedule, planned detours, or maps <a href="https://www.miamigov.com/Services/Transportation/Get-Trolley-Information-Schedules-and-Maps">visit the Miami Government&rsquo;s page on the Trolley&rsquo;s website</a>. </p>
<h2 id="bikes">Bikes</h2>
<p>Miami is not really known as a bike-friendly city; it&rsquo;s actually listed as <a href="https://www.carinsurance.org/deadliest-cities-for-cyclists/">one of the most dangerous city to bike in the U.S.</a> If you do want to ride, though, do it as a way to see the scenery. Some great places to bike in Miami include South Pointe Park and Pier, Amelia Earhart Park and Everglades National Park. Always wear a helmet and take extra precautions if you plan to bike at night or somewhere like Rickenbacker Causeway or any other bridges or causeways. </p>
<h2 id="car-rentals">Car Rentals</h2>
<p>You can pick up a car at Miami International Airport and drop it off there again before your departure. There are other car rental locations spread out around town. If you don&rsquo;t need a car for the duration of your trip, but just a few days, you can reserve one in the Miami Beach area or near the downtown/Midtown neighborhoods. Parking in Miami is a breeze, but if you&rsquo;ll be staying at a hotel, make sure to check their valet and parking fees ahead of time. There is also an app called <a href="https://www.getaround.com/cities/miami-car-rental">Getaround</a>, which allows you to rent a local&rsquo;s car for the day or just a few hours at a reasonable price. With this particular app, you can reserve a car nearby (often in walking distance) within minutes. The car unlocks and locks again with the app, which requires you to inspect for any bumps or scratches and take a photo of the gas level at pickup (and dropoff). As long as you leave the car with the same amount of gas it had at pickup, you should be fine; otherwise, you might be charged to refill the tank. </p>
<h2 id="tips-for-getting-around-miami">Tips for Getting Around Miami</h2>
<ul>
<li>Miami parking can get quite expensive. Taking public transit is a great way to avoid those high parking fees.</li>
<li>Renting a car is always a good idea in Miami, but if you plan to drink, park it and take public transportation or rideshare. </li>
<li>Make sure to carry a debit or credit card. Cash is not accepted at the fare gates for the Metrorail.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re driving, don&rsquo;t get gas near the airport. The cost is often upwards of $4.99 a gallon.</li>
