      <description>GETTING AROUND MIAMI USING METRORAIL Metrorail is a 25-mile elevated rail system similar to a monorail, but with two tracks. This is a fast and inexpensive way to get you from the Miami International Airport (MIA) through Downtown Miami all the way to South Miami. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to reach the Civic Center, Jackson Memorial Hospital area, Hialeah, and northwest Miami-Dade, with connections to Broward and Palm Beach counties at the Tri-Rail/Metrorail transfer station.</description>
