<h3 id="taxi">Taxi</h3>
<p>Hailing a yellow, metered taxi is easy except during rush hour and rain storms. Finding a taxi driver that speaks English is hard. Show the driver your destination address in Chinese characters; most drivers are unable to read pinyin.</p>
<p>Fare Rates: Make sure the driver turns on the meter, which begins at NT$70 for the first 0.77 miles and NT$5 for each additional 0.12 miles. A NT$20 surcharge is added to rides after 11 p.m. Some taxis take credit cards, but ask before your ride begins. Pay in NT$100 or NT$500 notes as most drivers won’t have change for NT$1,000 notes. Taxi dispatch +886 800 055 850 (Press 2 for English service) or 55850 from a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Rideshares like Uber and Lyft are popular as is <a href="https://linetaxi.com.tw/">LINE TAXI</a>, a taxi-hailing service from the <a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a> mobile app, a popular communication and payment app. Rideshares accept credit card payments.</p>
