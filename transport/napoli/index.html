<p> It is fairly difficult to get a clear picture of the public transportation system in Naples since different lines are operated by different companies. Tickets are available for 90 minutes or for daily, weekly, monthly, and annual travel. Biglietto Orario (hourly): €1.50 (valid for 90 minutes from the time the ticket is validated). Biglietto Giornaliero (daily): €4.50 (valid until midnight on the day the ticket is validated)<a href="https://www.napoliunplugged.com/naples-unicocampania-fares#:~:text=Tickets%20are%20available%20for%2090%20minutes%20or%20for,midnight%20on%20the%20day%20the%20ticket%20is%20validated%29">[13]</a>. The Unico Campania pass<a href="http://www.unicocampania.it/index.php?lang=en">[14]</a> banner which has great integrated maps of the various lines in the city on their website. Naples Sightseeing Pass<a href="https://www.visitacity.com/en/naples/activities/all-activities?activitiesCategoryId=365620&amp;campaginid=418301362&amp;adgroupid=1277632895060224&amp;targetid=kwd-79852274605225&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Naples%20ActivitiesC21X%20G-REST-In-EUR&amp;utm_term=naples%20sightseeing%20pass&amp;utm_content=Sightseeing%20Passes">[15]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Metropolitana di Napoli</strong> <a href="https://www.metropolitanadinapoli.it/">[16]</a>. There are three lines of underground subway in Naples. Many subway stations are regarded as fine examples of contemporary architecture and artistic urban decoration, being part of the <em>Stazioni dell&rsquo;Arte</em> project. They are generally safer than other public transport because they are always monitored by cameras and security officers. But the subway does not run frequently, so do not rely on it if you are in a hurry. The most important ones:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linea 1, built recently, connects the city center to the hill quarters, like Vomero and the hospital area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linea 2, much older, connects the three main train stations to Pozzuoli. The tracks are shared with the ordinary railway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linea 6, a new light subway connecting Fuorigrotta to Mergellina.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funicolare</strong><a href="https://www.anm.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=100">[17]</a>. The subway company also operates four cable cars: three of them connect the city center to Vomero, and the last connects Mergellina to Posillipo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trams</strong> <a href="http://www.anm.it/">[18]</a>. ANM operates three tram lines (1, 2, and 4), of which one goes along the shore of Castelnuovo - Garibaldi (Central Station).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buses</strong> <a href="http://www.anm.it/">[19]</a>. ANM also operated all bus lines within Naples, most of which are circular. Naples suffers from a serious problem of traffic jams and usually buses are overcrowded, so if you can (unless in the evening or on the weekend) try to avoid them. Another point to note is that unlike in Rome, tickets are not sold on buses. The bus company assigns staff to check if a passenger has a ticket. The staff members are notorious for targeting at tourists who are unfamiliar with the ticket-selling system. Once they see the tourists get into a bus, they will ask to see a ticket. No matter how much you explain, they will insist on getting your passport first and then require you to pay a penalty of 41.2 euros. If you do not pay, they will threaten to call the police. Again, if you can, try to avoid taking a bus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three different regional train services that operate in Naples and the surrounding areas. They are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Circumvesuviana</strong>. The Circumvesuviana railway operates from &ldquo;Napoli Porta Nolana - Corco Garibaldi&rdquo; and stops at the lower level of the central train station at Piazza Garibaldi and has six routes that service the local Naples area. One route goes from Naples to Sorrento with several stops in between, including Ercolano (Herculaneum) and Pompei Scavi (Pompeii) for the ruins. Another route travels around Vesuvius. Other routes go to Acerra and Nola-Baiano. The Circumvesuviana website <a href="https://www.sorrentoinsider.com/en/naples-to-sorrento-train-schedule">[20]</a> has more information on timings, routes, and cost of tickets. When buying tickets please note that the Circumvesuviana is run by EAV so the Trenitalia machines around the station will NOT work for your tickets so don&rsquo;t waste your (and other people waiting for the machine&rsquo;s) time - you need to line up and buy your ticket from the windows near the platforms. If you are going to Sorrento be careful to check the display announcing train arrivals and departures to be sure you are boarding the route to Sorrento and not Sarno!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cumana</strong>. This rail line that operates from Montesanto in Naples and follows the coastline for approximately 20 km before ending in Torregaveta (Bacoli). The Cumana runs the urban centers of Montesanto, Fuorigrotta, Bagnoli, Pozzuoli, Arco Felice, Baia, and Fusaro before reaching Torregaveta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Circumflegrea</strong>. This rail line also starts in Montesanto and ends in Torregaveta. However, it runs along the western edge of Naples through the districts Soccavo, Pianurat, Quarto Flegreo, Licola, and Cuma. It is also approximately seven kilometers longer than the Cumana. because the Cumana and Circumflegra start and end in the same places one can quickly transfer from one train to the other. Both services are owned and operated by the same company and more information can be found at the S.E.P.S.A website<a href="https://www.napolike.com/circumflegrea-here-is-the-new-summer-timetable-of-2023">[21]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional Trains</strong>. In Addition to the aforementioned trains, Trenitalia operates regional trains from Naples to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Salerno" title="Salerno">Salerno</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="by-ferryhydrofoiledithttpswikitravelorgwikienindexphptitlenaplesactioneditsection21-edit-section-by-ferryhydrofoil">By ferry/hydrofoil[<a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Naples&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: By ferry/hydrofoil">edit</a>]</h3>
<p>There are several ferry/hydrofoil services that connect Naples and local ports/islands. Ferry and hydrofoil services leave from either Molo Beverello, Mergellina, or Pozzuoli. Some then of them are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AliLauro</strong> <a href="http://www.alilauro.it/">[22]</a> has a hydrofoil service that connects Naples with the islands of Ponza, Ventotene, Prochida, Ischia, Capri, and Eolie, and the towns of Formia, Castellamare, Sorrento, Positano, Amalfi, and Salerno. Alilauro operates from both the Molo Beverello and Mergelina.</li>
<li><strong>L.N.G.</strong> <a href="https://www.nlg.it/en/">[23]</a> has a hydrofoil service that connects Naples with the island of Capri, along with Sorrento, Positano, and Amalfi. Schedules and timings can be found on its website.</li>
<li><strong>Metro del Mare</strong> <a href="https://www.napolike.com/metro-of-the-sea-from-naples-to-cilento-here-are-the-timetables-and-stops">[24]</a> has several lines that connect Naples and Sapri; Bacoli and Salerno and Sorrento; Monti di Procida and Salerno; and, Amalfi and Sapri. Besides the main stops the ferry service also connects many smaller communities. The Metro di Mare webpage has schedules, timetables, and locations of ticket counters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Just a note: the ferries to Capri can be over rough seas. Get on a ferry with an outside deck, and take Gravol or something similar before you sail. Nothing like being on a boat for 70 min surrounded by people who are vomiting to get your day off to a bad start</strong>.</p>
