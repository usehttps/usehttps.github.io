<p>Under Australian law, all drivers and passengers must wear seatbelts. Helmets which meet Australian Standards are required to be worn if riding a motorcycle, moped, motor scooter or bicycle.</p>
<p>The ACT default speed limit in a built up areas is 50 km/h, unless a sign shows a higher or lower speed limit on a length of the road. The default speed limit in a rural area in the ACT is 100 km/h. Speed limits are strictly enforced.</p>
<p>It is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 per cent or higher, or to drive under the influence of illegal drugs.  </p>
<p>If driving in a remote or country area, carry up-to-date maps and always inform someone of your intended route. In country areas, particularly at dawn and dusk, remain alert to native animals such as kangaroos, wombats and possums which may stray on the road.</p>
<p>Drive on major and sealed roads where possible and avoid driving at night. Please be aware of cyclists who often share the roads in special bike lanes on the left hand side of main roads.</p>
<p>Hitchhiking or picking up hitchhikers is strongly discouraged.</p>
