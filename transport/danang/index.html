<p><strong>*To Da Nang</strong></p>
<p>Basically you should use flight from Ho Chi Minh (biggest city) or Ha Noi (capital) to Da Nang. Approximately 1 hour flight from both cities.</p>
<p>From Da Nang airport, you should use Grab taxi to get to your hotel or to the city and it should be less than 20 USD.</p>
<p><strong>*Inside Da Nang:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taxi with Grab:</strong> A popular choice of transport is <strong>Grab</strong> (similar to Uber). Grab is relatively cheap with plenty discount codes, convenient, and private. Most importantly, Grab is transparent. All prices are reflected on the app, no hidden fee and charges, no matter what anyone tell you otherwise. However, at rush hour, Grab will likely slow you down in the central city. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.grab.com/vn/en/download/">https://www.grab.com/vn/en/download/</a></p>
<p>Currently, Grab offers GrabCar, GrabCar Plus, and GrabCar 7. GrabTaxi is another option inside the app, too. This will book a regular taxi through the app but will tell you the price ahead of time. Many taxi drivers also work for Grab. </p>
<p>The Grab app also offers the ability to hire a driver by the hour for both moto-taxis and cars. This is useful if you want to see a few tourist attractions or parts of the city and don’t want to repeatedly order rides after each one. </p>
<p>Vehicle models in Vietnam are a bit different from those in other countries, so with GrabCar, don’t be surprised if something the size of a Toyota Yaris shows up. GrabCar Plus will be a bit bigger—something mid-size like a Toyota Camry. And with GrabCar 7, it’s always been some type of SUV whenever I’ve used it—something like a Toyota Fortuner.</p>
<p>Within the app, you can book motorcycle taxis (GrabBike), car taxis (GrabCar), private car services, food delivery (GrabFood), order groceries, and more. You can read my guide on how to use the Grab app. </p>
<p>You don’t need to input or use your credit or debit card in the Grab app. You can select Cash for GrabFood and GrabTaxi and pay on delivery or after getting a taxi ride. But I recommend to register paying by credit card to prevent all of the scams may exist.</p>
<p><strong>Bus:</strong> Please avoid buses and taxis at all costs. Buses are regularly late, improper, and known for pick pockets. Taxis will charge you double or triple if you ever let out that you are tourists. I&rsquo;ve known horror stories of even Asian tourists getting charged 3 times as much when speaking to each other in a foreign language on taxis. </p>
<p><strong>Renting a motorbike:</strong> Of course, the daredevil in you might whisper for a ride on the motorbike/ scooter. It&rsquo;s cheap (150k - 250k/ day plus gas), convenient, and fashionable. However, keep in mind there are crazy drivers on the street, reckless car/ bus drivers as well, and there is always the risk of bike thieves.  A great fully automatic starter bike is the Honda Air Blade.</p>
