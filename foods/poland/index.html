<li>Bigos: This cabbage-based stew is an absolute must on the Christmas table of every single Polish household.

<li>Barszcz: Barszcz is a beetroot soup that can be served either hot or cold and is typically served with uszka – ravioli-type small dumplings filled with meat or cabbage and mushrooms.

5. Gołąbki: One of the best Polish food you can try is in the form of a cabbage roll.

This hearty dish is typically eaten for lunch or early dinner. Gołąbki means &ldquo;little pigeons&rdquo;.
