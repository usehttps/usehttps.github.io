<li>Dimsum: Dim sum is a traditional Chinese meal made up of small plates of dumplings and other snack dishes and is usually accompanied by tea. Dim sum means &rsquo;touch the heart&rsquo; in Chinese. The small portions were designed to merely touch the heart not sate the appetite, and as such were first enjoyed as snacks.

<li>粥 (Congee=Porridge): is a form of rice porridge made by boiling rice in a large amount of water until the rice softens.

<li>Egg Tarts: The dish consists of an outer pastry crust filled with egg custard. Egg tarts are often served at dim sum restaurants, Chinese bakeries and cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong-style cafes).

<li>Roast goose(siu ngoh 燒鵝):  is a variety of siu mei, or roasted meat dishes, within Cantonese cuisine. It is made by roasting geese with seasoning often in a charcoal furnace at high temperature. Roasted geese of high quality have crisp skin with juicy and tender meat.

<h2 id="famous-drinks">Famous Drinks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Nai Cha 奶茶 (Milk tea): The most common drink you can find in a cha chaan teng is the ever-popular milk tea (奶茶; naai5 caa4). Hong Kong-style milk tea is made with strong black tea and condensed milk, so it’s sweeter, smoother, and creamier than your average cup of black tea with milk. It’s usually served in a teacup if it’s hot—like the classic Black &amp; White branded ceramic sets you’ll often come across—or in a tall glass if it’s cold.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wEagsQL.jpg" width="300" /></li>
<li>Yuenyeung 鴛鴦(Coffee with milk tea): is a drink created by mixing coffee with tea. This particular drink is more commonly known as yuenyeung—which is how you should order it when you’re in a cha chaan teng. Named after a pair of mandarin ducks, this is the drink to have if you simply cannot decide between milk tea and coffee—so why not have both? It is usually one part coffee and two parts milk tea, resulting in a unique combination that is sure to give you a caffeine boost. The first sip is always sweet, followed by a subtle, bitter aftertaste.

<li>Grass jelly 涼粉/仙草: Grass jelly, also known as leaf jelly or herb jelly, is a jelly-like dessert originating from China. It is commonly consumed in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is created by using Chinese mesona (a member of the mint family) and has a mild, slightly bitter taste.
