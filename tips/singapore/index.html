<p>I went to Singapore in January for a week. Came back with some knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I stayed at Marina Bay Sands. Wasn&rsquo;t worth staying all 7 days considering we only went up to the pool once. However, it was definitely worth experiencing. When I go again, I will stay for one night, spend the entire time in the pool, and stay at a cheaper hotel for the rest of the trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVED the heat and humidity. Not being sarcastic. It was great! However, I wanted to look super cute and stylish. Do yourself a favor and abandon this hope right now. You&rsquo;re gonna be a ball of sweat and are most likely going to be walking a lot, plus the air conditioning is gonna turn all that sweat to ice instantaneously upon entering an establishment or the MRT. Next time, I&rsquo;m going to experience SG by way of running shoes, athletic wear, and a light jacket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a locked US phone, you&rsquo;re not okay. I thought I&rsquo;d be alright because SG has free wifi all over the place and I have a newer model smartphone but alas: to get access to the free wifi, they have to send you a text (in my case, this was costly). Next time, before I leave I&rsquo;m getting an unlocked smartphone with GPS/maps and a currency exchange app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tourist 1- and 3-day MRT/bus passes (<a href="http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com.sg">http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com.sg</a>) are NOT worth it. I got one while my companion used a regular pass, and I got royally screwed. Also, I found customer service to be universally terrible outside of MBS with the only exception being taxi drivers. Which leads me to&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TAKE THE GODDAMN TAXIS. They&rsquo;re dirt cheap and they already know how to get to wherever you need to go. Save time and energy and headache. Let them drive you to the front door of wherever you want to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gardens by the Bay is better at night. I went during the day and was underwhelmed, though the flower domes were really inspiring. Also, I have a feeling the Marina Bay Merlions would have been more majestic during the day, but get there early, maybe before 9am if you can, because PEOPLE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sentosa Island was the best day of my whole trip. We bought a Fun pass (<a href="http://www.sentosa.com.sg/state-specials/sentosa-fun-pass">http://www.sentosa.com.sg/state-specials/sentosa-fun-pass</a>) that allowed us to do five attractions, so (1) Trick Eye Museum, (2) Madam Tussaud&rsquo;s, (3) Images of SG or whatever&ndash; it&rsquo;s a heavily sanitized but lighthearted guided tour of the history of SG, (4) Merlion, and (5) Skyline luge. DO THESE THINGS. Only thing I would have done different is taken the skyline ride to Mt. Faber and seen the Mt. Faber Merlion/happiness bell before coming back to Sentosa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore Slings at the Long Bar at Raffles hotel are $31 SGD. Plus there&rsquo;s an insane tax, which means that two Singapore Slings from this place ended up being close to $75 SGD. They were delicious but they don&rsquo;t even let you keep the glass for that much. I don&rsquo;t recommend drinking alcohol on your trip. Drink the water. Stay hydrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Saber Authority (<a href="http://www.thesaberauthority.com">http://www.thesaberauthority.com</a>) was SO COOL. If you&rsquo;re into Star Wars and can make it to a class, it&rsquo;s well worth it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Souvenirs are basic and lacking in creativity, like SG only has one souvenir manufacturer and everything must be approved by committee. If you want keychains, shirts, wine openers, etc. you&rsquo;re in luck. If you&rsquo;re looking for a unique souvenir, you&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to find one. I mean, all I wanted was a Merlion lucky cat statue of some kind. Did I find one? NoOOoOo. But had I wanted a 5lb Merlion paperweight, I would&rsquo;ve been covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not buy $32 SGD sunscreen from the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. What a crime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
