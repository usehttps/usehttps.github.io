      <description>Experiences I went to Singapore in January for a week. Came back with some knowledge.
I stayed at Marina Bay Sands. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth staying all 7 days considering we only went up to the pool once. However, it was definitely worth experiencing. When I go again, I will stay for one night, spend the entire time in the pool, and stay at a cheaper hotel for the rest of the trip.</description>
